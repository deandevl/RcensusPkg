tiger_places_sf(
  state = NULL,
  output_dir = tempdir(),
  delete_files = TRUE,
  vintage = 2020,
  general = FALSE,

  transform_crs = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The required two-digit FIPS code for the state of interest.
See \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=usmap}{usmap::fips function} for finding FIPS codes.}

\item{output_dir}{A full directory path where the shapefile and its associated files will be downloaded.
The default is the directory defined by the value returned by \code{tempdir()}.}

\item{delete_files}{A logical which if TRUE will delete the shapefile and associated files in 'output_dir'.
The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{vintage}{A numeric that sets the vintage of interest. The default is 2020.
The value should be greater than 2010.}

\item{general}{A logical which if \code{TRUE} will download a less detailed, more generalized version of the places geometries.}

\item{set_crs}{A numeric or character string which if non-NULL calls sf::st_crs() to set the crs of the geometries and transforms them.}

\item{transform_crs}{A numeric or character string which if non-NULL calls \code{sf::st_transform()}
to perform a crs transform of the geometries. Note that the crs of the shapefile must not be NA.}

\item{sf_info}{A logical which if \code{TRUE} displays info on the resulting simple feature object.}

\item{do_progress}{A logical which if \code{TRUE} displays a progress bar during the download.}

\item{shapefile}{A full file path to a shapefile folder with its unzipped files to be processed instead of downloading.}

\item{express}{A logical expression object used to filter the resultant simple feature dataframe.
For example, one of the columns of the resultant simple feature dataframe is "NAME" for major places.
Say we wanted to return just the geometries for major places in Kentucky such as "Bowling Green" and "Louisville".
We would assign 'express' equal to: expression(NAME \%in\% c("Bowling Green", "Louisville" )). The expression will be
evaluated and only the geometries for the two places will be returned.}

\item{check_na}{A logical which if \code{TRUE} will remove rows that have missing values for any of the columns.
The default is to not check the columns for \code{NA} values.}
}
\value{
A data frame object of class sf
}
\description{
This function performs three tasks:
\enumerate{
\item Download to an output directory a zip file from the TIGER/Line Shapefiles database.
\item Unzip the zip file and locate the shape file of interest.
\item Read and convert the shape file to a simple feature object.
}
}
\details{
Returns simple feature (sf) places related geometric polygons provided
by the US Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Shapefiles database. See
\href{https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html}{Simple Features for R}
for more information on simple features. Along with the geometries, additional places related
variables are provided.  See
\href{https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2022/TGRSHP2022_TechDoc_F-R.pdf}{Appendix I-5. Record Layout: Place State-based Shapefile}
for a description of place related variables of the sf file.
For further information on the Census Bureau's shape files see
\href{https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2021/TGRSHP2021_TechDoc_Ch3.pdf}{About the 2021 TIGER/Line Shapefiles}.
From \href{https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2022/TGRSHP2022_TechDoc_Ch4.pdf}{4.14 Places â€“ Incorporated Places and Census Designated Places} --

"Incorporated Places: An incorporated place provides governmental functions
for a concentration of people. Incorporated places may extend across county and county subdivision
boundaries, but never across state boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or
borough, but can have other legal descriptions."

"Census Designated Places (CDPs): CDPs are the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are settled concentrations of
population that are identifiable by name but not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which
the CDPs are located."

The function returns the simple feature object which can easily be mapped (see \href{https://github.com/deandevl/RplotterPkg}{RplotterPkg::create_sf_plot()}) or
joined with US Census Bureau demographic data via the GEOID value.

Some earlier vintages may have NA for the crs so you may need to specify the 'crs_transform' to 3426.  Also
you may be interested in using a state level crs.  See \href{https://epsg.io/}{epsg.io} to search worldwide for crs.
